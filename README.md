Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a self-taught software engineer determined to make a career leap from journalism to technology! Although I loved my time in journalism, I enjoy programming even more — from the frustration I feel getting stuck on a coding problem, to the immense euphoria I get after successfully deploying a full-stack application! But most importantly, I am passionate about using code to build programs that help foster belonging (a common theme among my projects heretofore)! <br>👨‍💻 <b>Check out my website <a href="https://ftrichardson.github.io/portfolio/">here</a></b>!

<br>
🎸 My most recently completed project is [Aux Cord](https://aux-cord.onrender.com/).<br>
🌱 I am currently working on [Habit Coach](https://habit-coach.netlify.app/).<br>
🔭 I would like to build a quiz app that socializes the trivia-learning experience while waiting in long lines!
