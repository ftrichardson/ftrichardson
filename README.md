Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a self-taught software engineer determined to make a career leap from journalism to technology! Although I loved my time in journalism, I enjoy programming even more — from the frustration I feel getting stuck on a coding problem, to the immense euphoria I get after successfully deploying a full-stack application! But most importantly, coding empowers individual to make significant social impacts, so I am passionate about building programs that help foster belonging!

🎶 My most recently completed project is [Aux Cord](https://aux-cord.onrender.com/). <br>
🌱 I am currently working on [Habit Coach](https://habit-coach.netlify.app/).<br>
