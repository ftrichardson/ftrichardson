Hi 👋🏽! I’m Flynn, a self-taught software engineer determined to make a career leap from journalism to technology! Although I loved my time in journalism, I discovered last year that I love programming even more — from the frustration I feel when stuck on a coding problem, to the euphoria I experience after successfully deploying a full-stack application. But most importantly, I love that code can empower mere individuals to create significant social impact, and I am passionate about using code to build programs that help <b>foster belonging</b> (a common theme among my technical projects heretofore). <br>

🎸 My most recently completed project is [Aux Cord](https://aux-cord.onrender.com/) (<b>human connection</b> via music).<br>
🌱 I am currently working on [Habit Coach](https://habit-coach.netlify.app/) (<b>human connection</b> via habit-building).<br>
🔭 I would like to next build a quiz app that socializes the trivia-learning experience while waiting in lines (<b>human connection</b> via knowledge)!
