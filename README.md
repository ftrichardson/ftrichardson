<h2>Welcome! 👋🏽</h2>

I’m Flynn, a self-taught software engineer determined to make a career leap from journalism to technology! Although I enjoyed my time in journalism and will never stop writing, I enjoy programming even more — from the frustration I endure when stuck on a coding problem, to the immense euphoria I feel after writing a complex function or successfully deploying a full-stack application! But most importantly, I love that code empowers us to create significant social impact, and I am passionate about using code to build programs that help <b>foster belonging</b> (a common theme among my projects heretofore)! <br>
