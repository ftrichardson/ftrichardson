Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Flynn 👋🏽, a self-taught software engineer determined to make a career leap from journalism to technology! Although I enjoyed my time in journalism and will never stop writing, I enjoy programming even more — from the frustration I endure getting stuck on a coding problem, to the immense euphoria I feel after successfully deploying a full-stack application! I am passionate about using code to build programs that help <b>foster belonging</b> (a common theme among my projects heretofore)! <br>

🎸 My most recently completed project is [Aux Cord](https://aux-cord.onrender.com/).<br>
🌱 I am currently working on [Habit Coach](https://habit-coach.netlify.app/).<br>
🔭 I would like to build a quiz app that socializes the trivia-learning experience while waiting in long lines!
